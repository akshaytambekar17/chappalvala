                                    <span><a href="#">By Chappalvala - </a>5 Nov 2018 </span>
                                    <p>With sneakers so prevalent in every cool girl’s wardrobe over the past few seasons, we’ve tried out nearly every shape, color, and style of the sporty footwear that exists. We’ve gone high-top and low-top, velvet, satin, and trusty leather. We have an embellished pair to dress up more understated looks and a decidedly less loud style to pair with that printed dress for summer barbecues and more. When it comes to actual running sneakers, though, choosing the right style can be tough. A pair that mixes style and function is not always easy to come by.</p>
                                    <p>When seeking those stylish running sneakers, it’s a non-negotiable that they actually be a style you can run in. Gone are the sporty kicks that merely look like you could take them on a jog, only to discover they’ve given you blisters and shin splints—at mile one. But with a nod to function, it’s time to up the sartorial bar, forgoing the boring white and black sneakers your parents have been jogging in for years.</p>
                                    <p>Lucky for all us fashion girls, athletic brands have begun to release a large selection of shoes that are not only among the best running sneakers out there but also super stylish. Wear them with leggings and a sports bra for a summertime run in the park and then afterward to Sunday brunch with friends, swapping that sportswear for a pair of jeans. Hey, you could even wear most of the below styles with a cute sundress if you’re feeling ambitious. Your toes will certainly thank you! At every price point, shop the below 20 styles below, just in time for summer. These chic running sneakers are the athletic addition your already incredible shoe closet.</p>
